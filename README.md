Privacy Policy for Sidekick (ChatGPT Extension)

Sidekick is a browser extension that helps you organize your ChatGPT conversations using folders, colors, and renaming features.
We do not collect, store, or share any personal data.

All your data (folders, chats, names, colors) is stored locally in your browser using chrome.storage.local.

If you submit a bug report or feature request, that feedback is optionally sent via email or a form of your choosing, and only includes what you write.
